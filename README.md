Scamper Chat
============

This is an IRC-like chat application consisting of a server, a command-line
client and some libraries for shared code.  It uses SCTP rather than TCP
in its wire protocol, and the 
[scamper](https://github.com/timboudreau/scamper) library that makes it easy
to write protocols using SCTP.


Features
--------

 * Multiple chat rooms, IRC-style, with similar commands
 * Ansi-colored shell client
 * End-to-end Blowfish encryption on password-protected rooms - meaning that the
server cannot decrypt the chat messages (the server does store a SHA-512 hash
of the password to reject access, but has no way to decrypt messages).

This project serves as a demo of how to write servers with Scamper, in addition
to being usable in its own right.


Requirements
------------

 * Java 8
 * [Cryptography Extensions for Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html) 
if you  (sorry!) want to use password-protected rooms
 * *Linux Users* need [lksctp-tools](http://lksctp.sourceforge.net/) - if you see an error about loading native libraries, you don't have it

If either of the latter are missing, the client will let you know.


Configuration
-------------

The client by default attempts to connect to a public server that is up for the
time being (no promises), so it can be run with no arguments:

`java -jar scamper-chat-client.jar`

To connect to a different server, pass `--port` and `--host`
on the command-line, e.g.

`java -jar scamper-chat-client.jar --port 8007 --host foo.bar.com`

The server can be configured similarly using command-line options


Subprojects
-----------

 * **Scamper Hub** - the server - build and run with `java -jar`
 * **Scamper Chat CLI** - command-line ansi-colored chat client featuring IRC-like commands (`/join`, `/who`, `/rooms`, etc.) - also build and run with `java -jar`

The rest are supporting projects for those:

 * **Scamper Chat Common** - POJO data types used in the wire protocol, and base
classes for clients
 * **Scamper Chat Message Types** - Defines the Scamper [MessageType](http://timboudreau.com/builds/job/scamper/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/scamper/target/apidocs/com/mastfrog/scamper/MessageType.html)s that
are used by client and server to choose handlers for particular kinds of messages
 * **Scamper Chat Client Base** - Base classes that provide a simple interface for
writing scamper-chat clients


Downloads And Builds
-----------------------

Building is as simple as cloning this repository and running `mvn install` (Maven 3.2.x or later and JDK 8 recommended).

Wire Format
-----------

The wire-format is BSON with gzip compression for larger messages; encryption
is applied to message bodies by the client and decrypted by receiving clients.
